## Tech Stack

**Client:** React(Vite), Material UI, React Router, Javascript

## Installation

NodeJS must be installed for the project to work.

- Download and install **node** (and **npm**): https://nodejs.org/en/
- Make sure you have an editor (I used VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Install dependencies

Open a terminal or command prompt inside the project folder, then install the dependencies.

```Bash
# Follow this command to add the node_modules folder.
$ npm install
```

### Start the project

Open a terminal or command prompt inside the project folder.

```Bash
# Follow this command to run the project.
$ npm run dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:5173/
